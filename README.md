# RADIO Retrospective Technique

I recommend applying the RADIO retrospective technique for helping systemize incident management.

## Why?
Generally, incident management process should consider 'Incident recognizing', 'Damage identifying', 'Resolving incident', and 'Reviewing the incident'.
And also should consider systematizing the process.
I suggest a retrospective technique to help you to build systematic incident management process.

## RADIO?
The RADIO retrospective technique requires 4 items:

- Recognizing incident and identify it. 
- Scale of damage.
- Addressing method.
- Improvement and prevention measures.
- Opinions on the issue.

Each item of RADIO is as follows:

### Recognition
* When did the issue occur?
* What is the issue?
* What is the cause?

### Action
* How to resolve it?
* What is incident addressing method?

### Damage
* Quantitative damage?
* Qualitative damage?

### Improvement
* How to improve it?
* How to prevent it?

### Opinion
* Additional opinions?
